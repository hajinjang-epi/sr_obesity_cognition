# sr_obesity_cognition
A systematic review of sarcopenic obesity and cognitive impairment in middle-aged and older adults.

The review finds that sarcopenic obesity is consistently associated with a higher risk of cognitive impairment compared with having neither condition, sarcopenia alone, or obesity alone. Although definitions of sarcopenia, obesity, and cognitive impairment varied across studies, most evidence suggests a potential synergistic effect when low muscle mass and excess adiposity coexist.
